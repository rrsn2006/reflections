How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

If I apply two diffs then i can see what was added and what was removed.
If something was added wrong, then I can correct it.
if something was removed mistakingly, then we can add it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
